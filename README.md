# C Programs

This repository contains C programs that I have written. The programs are written in C language and are compiled using GCC compiler.

## How to compile and run the programs

1. Install GCC compiler on your system. You can download the GCC compiler from the official website of GCC.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the C program is saved.
3. Compile the C program using the following command:
   ```
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```
   Replace `program_name` with the name of the C program.
4. Run the compiled program using the following command:
   ```
    ./program_name
    ```
    Replace `program_name` with the name of the compiled program.
